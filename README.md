### Backendless using LocalStorage to save state (alternate API actions included)
A quick solution to a given narrow hypothetical project definition to demonstrate ability.
No component libraries were used. Tailwind was used for styling and layout.
Design kept simple and functional and features minimal.
Testing with Jest and Vue Test Utils.

Tavle (tav-l√§) is the Nowegian word for 'whiteboard'.
